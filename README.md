# Brainhack2025 Github Demo
***Build and/or flex your git+github gunz***

## What's this all about?
Git and github are your friends, and like all good friends, also tools you can and should learn to utilize and wield with deftness and guile. 

***BUT*** - getting familiar with these tools is, as they say, "a journey". 

***SO*** - this repo is a fun group exercise aimed to help and enourage people to start and to continue that journey. 

## Get to the point dude...

**We want you*** - all of you - to build and/or flex your git+github gunz by do the following exercises on this repo: 

0. Fork this repo
1. Make an edit using the github GUI, and make a pull request
2. Make an edit using a local git clone, and make a pull request

***If those are not something that you can do in 30 seconds, this exercise is especially for you***

If you are ready to do some more advanced things, try the following: 

- Make an issue
- Review a pull request
- Do a cherry-pick commit
- Do a git rebase
- Use github codespaces
- Do github stuff in google colab
- Use github continuous integration (CI)
- Make / host a github website
  
If you are interested in these things and aren't sure what to do next, **ask and we + the AIs will help :) **
